Stanford dog imageset with sizes reduced to a maximum dimension of 350px

Image archive was downloaded from http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/ and decompressed.  The `resizeimages.py` script was then run in the top-level directory of the decompressed folder.  It reduces the image sizes to a maximum dimension of 350 (in either x or y) and saves the subfolders in groups of 5 to new zip files.
